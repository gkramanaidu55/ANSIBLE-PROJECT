# ANSIBLE-PROJECT
This project demonstrates how to automate and manage multiple "slave" laptops using a "master" laptop (Ansible controller) with the help of Ansible, Vagrant, and VirtualBox. The goal is to create a controlled environment where the master laptop can configure, provision, and manage multiple virtual machines (VMs) acting as slave nodes
